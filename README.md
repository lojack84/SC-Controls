# SC-Controls
1) Copy SC313 XML file into Live > User > Client > 0 > controls > Mappings
2) Open steam, select Games > Add Non Steam Game to Library > Navigate to RSIlauncher.exe
3) Plug in or connect your steam controller
4) Select Library > Right Click RSI Launcher > Manage > Controller Configuration 
5) In the overlay select "Browse Configs" and search for "LOJ | Star Citizen Steam v3.13" and Apply Config
6) Close everything > re-open steam > Launch RSI Launcher
7) At the Star Citizen menu screen, navigate to controls and apply new SC313 keybindings to all control classes (Keyboard / Mouse / Controller) as this is a hybrid control scheme and simulates all 3 inputs.

Now that the controls are in your directory, and you have added the profile to steam you can launch the RSI launcher from steam, the control scheme has to pass through the RSI launcher so you will have to start the launcher from steam each time you want to play (For example, if you EXIT the game, and then launch again from the RSI launcher, it may not apply the overlay)
Once you launch the game, you can check to see if the overlay is applied by Holding left trigger and moving your thumb on the left or right trackbad, if working correctly you will see the overlays pop up.
